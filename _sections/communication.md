## Communication Policy

* Asking for help is always encouraged
* More is better than less
* A peer is better than a google search
* A google search is better than staring into the abyss†
* Stargazing is better than giving up
* “I don’t understand” is a valid question to ask
* Sharing is good, but always include a source. Do not spread misinformation
* Slack is your friend, use them to communicate with your class
* Be open and [honest](honesty.html) when you are struggling, feeling behind, or overwhelmed

† Don't stare into the [Abyss](http://blog.8thlight.com/justin-herrick/2012/09/18/adapting-to-change.html)
